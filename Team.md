# Team Stories

## Core Team

### LexManos

Lex's journey with Forge started way back in the pre-alpha days of Minecraft.  
Back when SpaceToad and Eloraam were designing the Forge API for their mods Buildcraft and RedPower, Lex submitted some fixes and cleanups for the code and buildscript.  
This led to eventually Lex joining the duo in developing the API proper, forming a team of three.  
When SpaceToad and Eloraam grew tired of developing Forge, instead preferring to work on their own mods, Lex was left as the sole team member - he was working on Forge itself, without desire or need to work on it for another mod like the other two.  

After creating a new, small team to keep working on Forge and some collaborations with the MCP team, Lex managed to keep Forge going up to now, expanding the API, adding a modloader with the help of some other team members, and growing the team to what it is today.  

His role today is as the project manager, making sure all of the teams work properly, and as one of the core developers, making some of the harder decisions about how certain things are implemented.

### cpw

cpw started in the Bukkit ecosystem - finding that plugins were limited, and disappointed with the fact that mods couldn't be used alongside them. He joined the MCPC team, attempting to join mods and plugins once and for all.

However, when encountering issues with multiplayer, cpw ported Risugami's Mod Loader to work on a server (separately from ModLoaderMP) so that it could be integrated into both Bukkit and Forge. This gathered the attention of the Forge team, who were having issues with RML and saw the potential in the port that cpw made.

Eventually, cpw was recruited to make a client side of his server modloader, forming the FML that was eventually merged into Forge itself.

He also influenced a lot of other systems in the modding world; he consulted with Mumfrey on some of the designs that went into SpongePowered's Mixin, developed what eventually became Mojang's Legacy Launcher, and built the super-speedy Event Bus system that Forge uses.

His role today is as one of the developers of the McModLauncher ecosystem that Forge is built on top of, the Mod Loader that is ultimately of his own design, and is one of the core maintainers keeping Forge running.

### Curle

Curle first appeared in the #minecraftforge IRC channel before moving on, later returning to Discord in 2018, helping out other modders in a casual fashion. They gained interest in the efforts of backporting the fresh ForgeGradle 3 toolchain to older versions of Minecraft, and took the lead on MCPConvert and surrounding efforts.

Curle joined the Forge team in an official capacity in 2020. They quickly learned how to pass communication between the Core team and that of the public eye, and became the de-facto Triager of the project, ensuring high quality contributions before they were ever seen by the Core team. This change in the purpose of the Triage team saw a large boost in productivity.

One of their first contributions was the team application system that saw a large number of people added to the team voluntarily, rather than through pure chance. This coincided with the separation of the Triage team into two roles, lessening the work load for newer members of the team.

Today, Curle is the Triage team leader and public communicator for all things Forge. They have spearheaded efforts such as streamlining communication through the Forge Update Network project, optimizing team workflows, and faciliating the creation of both the Forge Blog and ForgeJAM.


## Triage Team

### sciwhiz12

sciwhiz joined the team mostly passively, simply being a member of the community and helping out whenever possible. His answers to questions are always of a high quality, his investigations into problems always thorough, and his review of others' work always comprehensive and valuable.

He joined the team before the application system was created, getting involved with as much as possible with everything the team was struggling to deal with, greatly lessening the workload for the rest of us.

His work in the community is immense; he is one of the core team members of the Parchment project that adds documentation and parameters to the deobfuscated Minecraft code, is the lead admin of the Forge Community Wiki, and is continually helping out with other related communities, such as MMD.

Today, he is one of our three Senior Triage team members, making decisions on contributions and features, categorizing issues and helping distribute the workload to others.

### AshersLab

Ashers joined the team through the Forge Annual Parley of 2020 (FAP20, as we call it).
It was announced that Forge was, at the time, in need of extra triage team members, and Ashers was one of three people that answered the call.

Ashers was accepted on the basis that they had already been a positively contributing member of the community; their knowledge of modding stemming from their experience on the Minecolonies mod made them an excellent helper, and their code review was excellent.

Ashers quickly moved into more of a moderator role, due to time constraints from work preventing active triage work, and their personality was far more relaxed and forgiving, something we wanted for our moderation team at the time. Ashers' timezone also contributed to being able to monitor the community 24/7, which is a great help for us.

Today, he is one of several of our moderators keeping the community spaces relaxed and friendly.

### OrionOnline

Orion also joined through FAP20, and was also one of the Minecolonies developers, so he fit in well alongside AshersLab.

Orion had more of a taste for the backend development due to his day job, so he quickly moved to work on our toolchain; contributing lots of fixes to the ForgeGradle system that builds Forge and its' mods.

Eventually, Orion pioneered the change to a TeamCity CI system, a huge migration effort from the Jenkins system we were using before.

With Orion's work on the toolchain, rendering expertise, and knowledge of necessary infrastructure systems, he came to be a dependable member of the team.

### ChampionAsh5357

Champ joined the team through the application system, citing his prior work for the documentation (both the official ReadTheDocs page and the unofficial Forge Community Wiki) and his interest in language loaders as his reason for joining.

He has been a valuable member of the team, fixing inaccuracies and insufficiencies in our documentation with dilligence and speed when nobody else is available, and his work on modding in other languages via his example mods is valuable to everyone interested in experimenting with modding in any form.

Today, he remains as one of our most valuable triage team members and documentation maintainers.

## Collaborators

### Illyohs

Illy orginally joined to help out with language loaders - his Scorge project allows loading mods written with the Scala language (hence, language loader). He was later conscripted into updating Forge itself, earning the nickname "Patcherman".

He is currently a moderator in our communities.

`<filler>` Illy was born 10,000 years ago before the age of modern man. Born on the tallest mountain on the highest peak when the sun was at it's highest. An oracle came forth and said "This child shall be a forge contributor" to which the the child's parents asked "The fuck is forge? Reginald are you drunk? You have to lay off the hooch man" to which Reginald replied "I don't need to lay off you lay off!" but little did they know that Reginald was right and Illy spent the next 10 millennia honing their skills to lurk in the forge discord `</filler>`

### coehlrich

coehlrich's first introduction to the team was when AshersLab (one of our main moderators) joined a server that coehlrich had been helping with; he ended up hanging around the Forge communities more, and eventually submitted a high quality feature called Client Commands.

This sudden contribution was noticed, and coehlrich was involved with our update process very soon after, his work leading him to create an automated Github Actions workflow for updating the MCPConfig toolchain underlying Forge to a new version of the game very quickly.

This Github Actions workflow got coehlrich onto the toolchain team, where he now helps out with all infrastructure and updating work.

### SizableShrimp

Shrimp started contributing fixes to our toolchain; first solving a couple of issues we were having with ForgeGradle. FG is a notoriously confusing codebase for new developers, so he was very quickly brought into the team in a more permanent capacity to help out.

He submitted a formal application to join the triage team, citing his existing work and interest in the supporting projects as the primary reason for wanting to contribute further.

Today, he's one of the most valuable developers working on the toolchain, and helping update Forge every release cycle.
